Description: This package provides functions to generate 'core' transport networks from
    'complete' transport network datasets. It can take a transport network from
    'OpenStreetMap' and saved as an 'sf' object via 'osmextract' or other package
    and generate a smaller network that represents key routes enabling most people
    to get to within a certain distance of most places.
