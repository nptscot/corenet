\title{Generate a grouped network by edge betweenness from a preprocessed coherent network}
\usage{
coherent_network_group(
  coherent_network,
  key_attribute = "all_fastest_bicycle_go_dutch",
  n_group = 12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coherent_network}{A preprocessed 'sf' object containing the network data,
expected to have columns 'all_fastest_bicycle_go_dutch' and 'weight'.}

\item{key_attribute}{The attribute used to keep.}

\item{n_group}{The number of groups to divide the network into, based on edge
betweenness centrality.}
}
\value{
An 'sf' object with edges grouped and ranked based on their mean potential.
}
\description{
This function takes a preprocessed network and applies graph-based analysis to group
the network edges based on their betweenness centrality. The function assumes that
the input network has attributes relevant to cycling traffic dynamics, specifically
'all_fastest_bicycle_go_dutch' and 'weight'. It outputs a transformed network where
edges are grouped and ranked according to their mean potential, facilitating further
analysis or visualization of critical network pathways.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'coherent_network' is obtained from a previous function corenet
# Generate the grouped network
grouped_network = coherent_network_group(coherent_network)
