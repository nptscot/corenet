# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The UK government ambition is to make cycling and walking the preferred options for shorter journeys or as part of longer trips by 2040. However, existing methodologies for developing cycling networks often fail to align with real-world cycling behaviors and policy requirements. This paper introduces an innovative approach to generating cohesive cycling networks by integrating the requirements of the National Transport Agency of Scotland. Leveraging the Network Planning Tool (NPT), which predicts relative cycling demand across Scotland, we incorporate empirical cycling data, urban infrastructure information, and direct stakeholder input to create practical, policy-aligned network models. Our methodology employs hybrid growth strategies that balance network cohesion, connectivity, and directness while adhering to national guidelines. We evaluate the proposed network against existing infrastructure, demonstrating significant improvements in coverage, utility, and policy compliance. This study offers valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of incorporating real-world data and policy frameworks in the development of sustainable urban cycling networks.

# Introduction

Sustainable urban transport is critical for addressing the environmental, economic, and social challenges faced by modern cities. Cycling and walking are among the most eco-friendly modes of transport, offering numerous benefits such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering traffic congestion, and improving public health. Despite these advantages, the development of effective and cohesive cycling networks has been hampered by various challenges. These include fragmented infrastructure, lack of integration with other transport modes, and insufficient alignment with user behaviors and policy frameworks.

The Scottish government aims to make cycling and walking the preferred choices for shorter journeys or as part of longer trips by 2040. This ambitious target is part of a broader strategy to promote sustainable transport and reduce reliance on private vehicles. Achieving this goal requires the development of comprehensive and cohesive cycling networks that not only meet the needs of cyclists but also align with national transport policies.

Current methodologies for developing cycling networks often fail to incorporate real-world cycling behaviors and policy requirements effectively. This disconnect results in networks that are underutilized or impractical. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel approach to generating cohesive cycling networks that integrate the requirements of the National Transport Agency of Scotland. By leveraging the Network Planning Tool (NPT), which predicts relative cycling demand across Scotland, we aim to create network models that are both practical and policy-compliant. Our objectives are to:

- Develop a methodology that integrates empirical cycling data, urban infrastructure information, and policy requirements.
  
- Employ hybrid growth strategies to optimize network cohesion, connectivity, and directness.
Evaluate the proposed network against existing infrastructure to demonstrate improvements in coverage, utility, and policy compliance.

-Provide actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers to support the development of sustainable urban cycling networks.
